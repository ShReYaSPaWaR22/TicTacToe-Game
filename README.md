# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in C++! This console-based game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe in a 3x3 grid.

## About

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The game uses a `TicTacToe` class to handle the board, players, and game logic, providing a clean and modular structure. It allows two players to alternate turns until a win or draw is achieved.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Two-player mode (Player X vs. Player O).
- Board drawing functionality.
- Win detection (rows, columns, and diagonals).
- Draw detection when all board spaces are filled.
- Modular code following OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction).

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns entering the row and column number where they want to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all 9 spaces are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
